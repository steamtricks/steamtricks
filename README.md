# steamtricks

steamtricks provides workarounds for problems with Steam on Linux.

Valve has made it clear that support for the wider base of Linux distributions
is not a priority. This has led to a number of suboptimal experiences for users
not on an officially supported distribution. The goal of this project is to
provide workarounds and solutions to those problems in an easy to use package.
Currently, workarounds exist in some distribution packages and in various forums
and the like. This project aims to be the upstream source for packaging Steam
fixes.
